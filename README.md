## Leveraging Financial Insights and User Behavior to Propel Company Growth

### Summary

The analysis focuses on understanding the patterns in Google search traffic, particularly examining the effects of external events such as financial results releases on search traffic, investigating seasonality, and exploring the relationship between search traffic and stock price movements. This project is divided into four main parts:

1. **Analysis of Unusual Patterns in Search Traffic:**
   - Data for Google search traffic was loaded into a DataFrame, with a specific focus on May 2020 to assess the impact of MercadoLibre's financial results. The total traffic for May was compared to the median traffic across all months, to determine if the release of financial results led to increased search traffic.

2. **Mining Search Traffic Data for Seasonality:**
   - Hourly search data was grouped and analyzed to understand patterns by the hour of the day, day of the week, and week of the year. This was intended to identify any significant seasonal trends in the search data.

3. **Correlation of Search Traffic with Stock Price Patterns:**
   - The search traffic data and stock price data were merged to analyze correlations. New columns for lagged search trends, stock volatility, and hourly stock returns were created to study potential predictive relationships between search traffic and stock market performance.

4. **Time Series Forecasting with Prophet:**
   - The setup and execution of a Prophet forecasting model for Google search data aimed to project future trends. The model helped identify peak search times, most popular days for searches, and low points in search traffic through the year.

### Findings

- **Traffic Increase Analysis:**
  - There was a noticeable increase in search traffic in May 2020, coinciding with the release of MercadoLibre's financial results, suggesting that such events significantly influence search behavior.

- **Seasonality in Search Traffic:**
  - The data revealed clear patterns of search traffic varying significantly throughout the day, with specific days of the week and weeks of the year showing predictable trends, indicating a strong seasonal component in search behavior.

- **Search Traffic and Stock Price Relationship:**
  - The analysis did not conclusively determine a predictable relationship between lagged search traffic and stock volatility or hourly stock returns, indicating that while there may be correlations, they are not strong enough to predict stock movements reliably based on search traffic alone.

- **Prophet Model Insights:**
  - The time series model highlighted that midday hours typically see the highest search traffic, while the beginning of the workweek tends to be busier compared to the end. The model also pinpointed January as having the lowest search traffic, which could be useful for planning marketing strategies.

These findings help in understanding the dynamics of search traffic in relation to external business events and market conditions, offering valuable insights for strategic planning and operational adjustments.
